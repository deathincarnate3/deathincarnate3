- 👋 Hi, I’m @deathincarnate3
- 👀 I’m interested in ... making a spawn in by character game like rust, hurtworld, weed farming game, castle building and fighting base on a modular micro build system. some are just modular home with class in the pve servers and sometimes the bleed over into the regular world of pvp.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... fingernode fingerspell invented by myself and found on my facebook page it is the easiest form of a sign alphabet as it is based on math positions. like code.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... development of a app to teach people my sign alphabet using a match game that has enough places to do the whole thing 36 pieces with second tiles for definitions. it is 26 letter for the englis (american) alphabet and then 0 through 9. this is an open source project as i am broke and it is just a super easy sign alphabet that will catch on just as soon as an app is ready. I would also need a page for a website when done for the downloading i guess hopefully that won't be too expensive i am not working right now. i would also like the site to help pay me with donations to pay for my needed cancer treatments. and to pay for future projects including free game development and a livable wage for me and some techs. the eventual thing is to make an open source foundation to create free android learning products for people but hey these are my dreams!!! i do need friends so come one come all and participate with what you know.
